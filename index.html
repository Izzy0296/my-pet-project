        <h1>Lilo's Adventure</h1>
        <p>Pugs belong to the companion classification of dogs. Despite their stocky, muscular build, they are part of the toy group. Fully grown, these pups are 10 to 12 inches tall and weigh between 14 and 20 pounds. The average Pug life span is 12 to 15 years. With their gentle, playful personalities and sturdy bodies, Pugs make great canine companions for families with small children.</p>

    <h2>Lilo's Favorite Toys</h2>
    <p>Pugs are one of the oldest dog breeds around. Some enthusiasts claim they can be traced all the way back to the Shang Dynasty, which ruled China from 1600-1046 B.C. While Pugs did originate in China, most people agree that it was likely closer to 400 B.C. which is still quite impressive!</p>
